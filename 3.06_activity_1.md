# 3.06 Activity 1

In this activity, we will be using the table `district` from the `bank` database and according to the description for the different columns:

Create the connection between SQL and Python and extract all the information from the `loan` table where the status is either `A` or `B`. Use the _executable class_ to run the query/queries. You can test the query/queries in Workbench and then use them with Python.
